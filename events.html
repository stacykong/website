	<h3>Grand Hero Battles</h3>
	<p>
	Grand Hero Battles allow the player to obtain a specific enemy Hero upon completion of the maps, with a 3* version of the character obtained by completing the hard version of the map, and a 4* version obtained by completing the lunatic version of the map. 
	Losing a character will cause the player to get the game over screen, and Light’s Blessings cannot be used to revive fallen allies.
	</p>
	
	<h3>Event Maps</h3>
	<p>
	Event maps may be available on certain periods of time, and will give orbs upon completion. 
	There are usually special quests that go along with the maps. 
	Past event maps include Defensive Battle maps, Launch Celebration maps, and the Kozaki Yusuke maps.
	</p>
	
	<h3>Hero Gauntlet</h3>
	<img src = "gauntlet.png" style = "float: right; height: 308px; width: 392px">
	<p>
	The voting gauntlet is an event in which eight hero armies battle against each other to determine the most popular character. 
	The player may choose to support a certain character by joining that character’s army.
	In order to increase army’s score, the player must win battle against the rival army. The player’s team will consist of:
	<ul>
		<li>The leftmost character of the team the player selects</li>
		<li>The leader of a random friend also in the same team as you</li>
		<li>The leader of a random person in the same team as you</li>
	</ul>
	The score that the player adds onto the army’s total score is based upon the number of friends the player has (up to 10), 
	whether or not the player’s character in the team is the same character as the Hero whose army the player has joined (score multiplied by 1.1), 
	and whether or not the character uses Battle Flags to multiply the player’s score.
