	<h3>Movement Type</h3>
	
	<ul>
		<li>Infantry: The majority of the units are of this type. Infantry type units can move two squares at a time, but can only move one square at a time through forests.</li>
		<li>Armored: This type of unit looks similar to the infantry type unit but with armor. Armored type units are usually characterized by their high defenses and low speeds. They can move one square at a time.</li>
		<li>Cavalry: This type of unit can move three squares at a time, but cannot move through forests.</li>
		<li>Flying: This type of unit can move two squares at a time. Flying units can ignore the effects of terrains that might impact other movements, meaning that they can move through forests without getting slowed down and move through mountains and bodies of water.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h3>Weapon Type</h3>
	
	<ul>
		<li>Sword/Lance/Axe: These users target the foe’s defense. They must be adjacent to the foe in order to attack.</li>
		<li>Tome: Tome users target the foe’s resistance, and usually have low defenses. They attack foes from two spaces away.</li>
		<li>Bow: Bow users target the foe’s defense, and attack foes from two spaces away. They do extra damage to flying foes.</li>
		<li>Dagger: Dagger units target the foe’s defense, and attack foes from two spaces away. They are characterized by their weapons, which can temporarily reduce their target’s stats.</li>
		<li>Staff: Staff units are characterized by their assist skill, which heals allies. Their weapon targets the foe’s resistance from a range of 2, but their damage is reduced unless they have the passive skill Wrathful Staff.</li>
		<li>Breath: Breath users target the foe’s resistance, and must be adjacent to the foe in order to attack.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h3>Type</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Red (sword, red tome, red breath): effective against green units, weak against blue units</li>
		<li>Blue (lance, blue tome, blue breath): effective against red units, weak against green units</li>
		<li>Green (axe, green tome, green breath): effective against blue units, weak against red units</li>
		<li>Colorless (bow, dagger, staff): not effective nor weak towards any type of units, unless against a weapon with a special effect that grants it weapon advantage against colorless foes (e.g. Blarraven)</li>
	</ul>
