	<p>
		In addition, there may be a special login bonus, which may be due to specific events such as the voting gauntlet or the release of a new Fire Emblem game. This bonus is also made available in the present list at 12:00 PST.
	</p>
	
	<h3>Story Maps</h3>
	
	<p>Orbs may be obtained by clearing story maps, in both the main story and in the paralogues. 
		Each story map has a normal, hard, and lunatic mode, which correlates with the level of the opponents, and they all give 1 orb upon completion. 
		Some maps in the main story might have specific requirements, such as completing the map under a certain number of turns or surviving a certain number of turns (usually 6). 
		Nintendo adds new maps every two weeks or so, which is made available alongside a new banner consisting of new characters.
	</p>

	<h3>Quests and Missions</h3>
	<img src = "quest.png" style = "float: right; height: 400px; width: 225px">
	<p id = "ip1">The Quests & Missions menu can be found in the home menu. 
		It gives rewards upon completion of the quests, which ranges from orbs to shards and crystals. 
		There are monthly quests (which are separated into three parts), the Shards & Crystals quests (which gives universal shards for the completion of the last part of a main story chapter), and quests correlating with the newest map. 
		There may be other special quests for limited times.
	</p>
	
	<h3>Arena Duels</h3>
	<p>
	The arena allows the player to play against another player’s team. There are three categories that determine the items gained after each arena season.
	<ul>
		<li>Offensive score: This score is obtained by playing against another player’s team controlled by an AI, and can be doubled by using one of the bonus heroes in the player’s team. 
		The offensive score is based on the highest sum of winning consecutive matches (up to 7), with scores per battle decreasing by selecting lower difficulty teams and by losing characters in battle. 
		Battles can be initiated by pressing the battle button, upon which a dueling sword is used. 
		The rewards range from 500 to 2,500 hero feathers.</li>
		<blockquote>Note: Dueling swords are replenished every day at 12:00 a.m. PST. Dueling swords may also be replenished by using a dueling crest.</blockquote>
		<li>Defensive score: A defensive score might be obtained by having the player’s defending team (the team in the leftmost slot, controlled by an AI) defeat other teams. 
		This score is based upon the strength of the enemy team defeated, and can be doubled by having a bonus hero in the team. 
		The rewards range from 100 to 900 hero feathers.</li>
		<li>Tier rank: Rewards based upon tier rank is based upon the player’s score in relation to other people in the same rank as the player. 
		Tier rank may increase, decrease, or stay the same, based on the player’s tier rank. 
		Rewards include both orbs and feathers, and the relative amounts depends on the tier the player has moved to by the end of each arena season.
		</li>
	</ul>
